Add spaghetti recipe

**Servings:** 4  
**Prep Time:** 10 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 20 minutes

#### **Ingredients:**

- 400g spaghetti
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)
- 3 teaspoon dried parcil
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Cook the spaghetti:**  
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (usually 8-10 minutes). Drain and set aside.

2. **Prepare the sauce:**  
   In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. **Add tomatoes:**  
   Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, and sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the sauce to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, and let it cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

4. **Combine:**  
   Once the sauce has thickened, add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet and toss well to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.

5. **Serve:**  
   Divide the spaghetti among plates. Garnish with fresh basil and grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Serve immediately.

#### **Tips:**

- For a richer flavor, simmer the sauce for longer (up to 30 minutes).
- Add red pepper flakes for a spicy kick or stir in a splash of balsamic vinegar for extra depth.
  
Enjoy your delicious spaghetti!
